    title : Data Migration and Integration
    description : >
      The exponential growth of all dimensions of data (particularly unstructured data), has long since outstripped the capacity of legacy systems to deal effectively with the information management requirements of today. The requirement for many legacy systems to duplicate and integrate datasets in order to perform the traditional full text search further amplifies and compounds the already chronic data problem.
      We specialise in delivering bespoke configured connectors for data transformation no matter where the content or data sits or where it needs to migrate to.

Enterprises that have deployed search infrastructure have the ability to exploit this data and the opportunities that go with it.
      Search is the perfect tool for finding useful information that is buried under mounds of other irrelevant information and it can provide near real-time access across a wide variety of content types, managed in otherwise siloed systems. It can also provide a flexible and intuitive interface for exploring that information.

      A Search Application Assessment Service.  can be used when legacy search software is already in place, or when the customer is looking for guidance on search product choices, including the applicability of open source alternatives.  We adhere to a process that delivers clear recommendations about search application design, implementation or simply improvement strategies.

Where applicable, we work with you to build a business case for change, which includes suggested project plan for implementation.
