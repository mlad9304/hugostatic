    title : Data Migration and Integration
    description : >
      <p>The exponential growth of all dimensions of data (particularly unstructured data), has long since outstripped the capacity of legacy systems to deal effectively with the information management requirements of today. The requirement for many legacy systems to duplicate and integrate datasets in order to perform the traditional full text search further amplifies and compounds the already chronic data problem.</p>
      <p>We specialise in delivering bespoke configured connectors for data transformation no matter where the content or data sits or where it needs to migrate to.</p>
